# Chapter 02 Algorithm Analysis

## Exercise 2.1

2/N, 37, sqrt(N), N, NlogNlogN, NlogN, NlogN^2, N(logN)^2, N^1.5, N^2, N^2logN, N^3, 2^(N/2), 2^N.

NlogN and NlogN^2 have the same growing rate.

## Exercise 2.2

a. True  
b. False  
c. False  
d. False

## Exercise 2.6

a. 2^(2^N)  
b. O(log log D)

## Exercise 2.7

a. O(N)  
b. O(N^2)  
c. O(N^3)  
d. O(N^2)  
e. O(N^5)  
f. O(N^4)

## Exercise 2.8 | [.cpp](ex02_08.cpp)

- Method1: O(N^2 logN)
- Method2: O(N logN)
- Method3: O(N)

## Exercise 2.9

Algorithm 1 at 10,000 is about 16 minutes and at 100,000 is about 5.5 days. Algorithms 1â€“4 at 1 million are approximately: 7.5 years, 2 hours, 0.7 seconds, and 0.03 seconds respectively. These calculations assume a machine with enough memory to hold the entire array.

## Exercise 2.10

- O(N)
- O(N^2)
- The answer depends on how many digits past the decimal point are computed. Each digit costs O(N ).

## Exercise 2.11

- 2.5 ms
- about 3.37 (more than 5 times)
- 25 times
- 125 times

## Exercise 2.12

- 1200000
- about 400000
- 1200000^(0.5)
- 1200000^(1/3)

## Exercise 2.13

- O(N^2)
- O(N logN)
